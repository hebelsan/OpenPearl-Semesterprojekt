   /**
   \brief wrapper object to map PEARL tasks on posix threads

   This class provides all necessary operations for the compiler to realize the
   tasking functionality required by the PEARL language.

   All tasks use the same mutex from TaskCommon to enshure thread safety.

   The user code of each task is capsulated in a function [task name]_body.
   This body code is called from a wrapper function named [task name]_entry.
   This wrapper function, which is realized in task.h by a C-define,
   enshures the existence of the exeption handler and the propper
   initialization for thread cancellation.

   Task suspending is solved by reading from a pipe (pipeResume),
   continuation is solved by writing a 'c' to the pipe.

   Asynchronous SUSPEND and TERMINATE are realized by setting some flags
   inside a signal handler (without MUTEX-protection) and setting the
   priority of the target task to maximum. The operation ist done in
   the scheduleCallback-method, which is clled at each call of
   TaskCommon::setLocation(). The result is the following task state
   diagram. Note that the operations suspend and terminate differ
   whether they are called from the task itself, or by another task.
   The calling from another task leads to a differed state and
   completion of the action at a suitable point of execution from the
   task itself.
