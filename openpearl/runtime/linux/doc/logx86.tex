\section{Log}
This module supplies a logging facility. The implementation is
plattform dependend, since the presence of logging devices is
plattform dependend.
In Linux the default log file in {\em pearl\_log.txt} in the current working
directory.
Each log entry is printed with the current time.
The log level is used to filter the log requests.
