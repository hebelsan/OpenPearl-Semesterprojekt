The PEARL run time system for Linux Plattforms.

\section Introduction

PEARL tasks are mapped on pthreads with the SCHED_RR-scheduler,
which is available on all up to date linux systems (since kernel 2.6).
There is a risc of locking  the system by a programming error -
e.g an endless loop in a user task, since SCHED_RR-threads work
with better priority than all other normal linux applications
(including shells). This risc is limited by setting a maximum
execution time for the PEARL application.

To get access to SCHED_RR root priviledges are required.
To work as normal user only the completely fair scheduler of linux is used.
The behavior of the task is not the same as required by the
PEARL specification.

The run time system is written in C++ in a separate namespace 'pearlrt'.

Linux allows the usage of many cpu cores.
During the startup of the project only 1 core is used.

\todo the number of cores to be used should be placed in
a configuration file


\section DT Data Types
The run time system provides data types which behave like the PEARL data types.
The data types are implemented as C++ classes.
The compiler may translate to user PEARL code into C++ using these types.

\subsection rt1 realized types
-# Task
-# Duration
-# Clock
-# Character<S> as template
-# Ref Character
-# Fixed(x), with x=1..63 as template
-# Fixed63 (for internal usage)
-# TaskList (for internal usage)
-# Bit (with size from 1 to 64)

\subsection rt2 to be done
-# Interrupt


\section Tasks
Beside of the simple data types, PEARL provides multitasking at language level.
The task concept of PEARL relies on common data.
PEARL tasks are mapped to linux threads.
For each PEARL task a task object must be created and an task-body function.
The task object provides the methods for the PEARL tasking language elements
The task-body function contains the compiled task code.
The creation of the requied C++-statements for the task object and
task-body header, C-macros are used.

PEARL provides only static tasks. This allows to create static task objects.
The constructor is called before entering main().
During construction of the task object, the task object registers
in the TaskList, which is a static object containing all tasks in
the PEARL application.

\subsection ts Task Scheduling
PEARL provides prowerful statements to schedule tasks.
It is possible to activate or continue task on time based rules
and on externalevents (interrupts in PEARL).
The time based actions are realized with timers and RT_SIGNALS.
The RT_SIGNALS are delivered to the target thread in a reliable
way (normal signals may be lost).
The signals are treated by reading a signalfd() descriptor for incoming
signals in a separate thread (signalThread). Each arriving signal a
dispatched to the corresponding tasling method. The signal context
contains a pointer to the target task-object.

The structure looks like:

\dot
digraph G {
   graph[size="6, 4"];
   subgraph cluster_os {
       label = "<<thread>>\nFile: os.cc\nmain";
       style=filled; color=grey;
       node[shape="rect"];
       main -> signalThread[label="creates"];
   }

   subgraph cluster_task_obj {
       label = "File: task.cc\n task object";
       node[shape="rect"];
       activateHandler[style=filled, color=grey];
       continueHandler[style=filled, color=grey];
       activate;
       resume;
       continue;
   }

   subgraph cluster_timer {
       label = "<<CLOCK_REALTIME>>\nTimer";
       node[shape="rect"];
       activateTimer;
       resumeTimer;
       continueTimer;
   }

   signalThread -> activateHandler[label="calls"];
   signalThread -> continueHandler[label="calls"];

   activate -> activateTimer[label="setup"];
   resume -> resumeTimer[label="setup"];
   continue -> continueTimer[label="setup"];
   activateHandler->activateTimer[label="stop"];

   continueTimer->signalThread[label="SIGRTMIN+3"];
   activateTimer->signalThread[label="SIGRTMIN+1"];
   resumeTimer->signalThread[label="SIGRTMIN+2"];
}
\enddot
The colors indicate the active thread context.


\section Signals
PEARL was designed for experiment and automation control.
In the region of safety critical
systems, overflows of variable values should not occur without notice.
These situations are called SIGNAL in PEARL.
The term signal differs between PEARL and linux!
PEARL signals are a kind of exceptions.
Each runtime function throws exceptions in case of an unsafe situation.

All defined signals are derived from the class Signal.
The class Task provided the method setLocation(), which should be used
by the compiler as instrumentation of the code.
Before each executable source line, the filename and line number should be
set vie the me-pointer of the task.
The generic signal treatment routine just prints the last set location, the
execption type and exits the task-thread.


\section Logging
There is a tiny logging system to write messages (together with a time stamp)
on a disc file named pearl_log.txt' in the current working directory.
\todo It should be possible to configure the name for the log file and
the log level in an configuration file

\section I I/O system
The I/O-system is currently not planned.
The iostreams should not be used, since they are known be be not thread safe.
The standard library (glibc) functions are known be be thread safe.

\subsection ii Dations
\todo: dation implementation must be added here

\subsection Formatting
The formatting uses depending on the direction ether Source or Sink objects.
They are realized in separate classes. The connection between the Dations
and these obejcts must be provided by the dation implementation.

For output formatting (PUT) each data type has a formatting method in a
correspondig class (eq. PutFixed<S> for Fixed<S> types.

\todo realize the class PutUtils for positioning.

For input formatting (GET) each data type has a formatting method in a
correspondig class (eq. GetFixed<S> for Fixed<S> types.

The positioning is realized in the class GetUtils.

Example code:
\verbatim
// GET x FROM console BY T(13), SKIP;

pearlrt::Source* s = console.getSource();
pearlrt::GetClock::fromT(x, 13, 0, *s);
pearlrt::GetUtils::fromSkip(1, *s);
\endverbatim

\section st System start
On system start, some checks are done.
For details see the documentation of os.cc.
After all main-tasks became activated the system start thread wait
for user input.
A small command line interface is realized to monitor the system.

\todo realize a global timeout function to shutdown the complete application


\section cli Command Line Interface
There is a tiny command line interface.
All commands start with '/'.
List of commands:
- PRLI: list of all tasks
-
