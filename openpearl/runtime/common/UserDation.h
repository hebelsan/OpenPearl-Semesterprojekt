   /**
     This class provides mutual exclusion locking for dation operations.

     Single PEARL I/O-statements are mapped to multiple C++ methods call.
     These C++ statements should not become interrupted by others tasks
     working on the same dation.
     Therefore a locking mechanism is needed.

     The dation operations may throw exceptions. The mutual excluded
     block must be wrapped in a try atch block.

     All exceptions in the try catch block will be handed towards
     the updateRst()-method. If the rst-formatting element was set,
     the exception is treated, else it is rethrown.
     The call of endSequence() in the catch handler enshures proper
     unlocking of the dation object.

     A simple mutex variable is defined and some methods to lock
     and unlock this variable according the dation operations.

     Furthermore, this class is responsible to cooperate with Task.h
     to realize suspend/continue/.. while dation operations are in progress.
     The current task working with this dation is specified by 'me' at
     the call of beginSequence().
